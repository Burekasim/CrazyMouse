# CrazyMouse
### Did your co-worker forget to lock the computer again when he left the room?
## Run CrazyMouse.exe on his computer!


**What does it do?**
This is a very simple piece of Python code that uses a PyAutoGUI, time and random python library to move the mouse randomly on the screen forever (or until the computer restarts).

**Why did you write this?**
My co-workers took over my computer when I left the room for a few moments, and I was looking for a creative way to avenge them.

**H E L P !!!, someone installed it for me on the computer, how do I disable it?**
Very simple, using the Task Manager or by restarting the computer.
###### (If this keeps happening, then your co-worker is very creative and he made sure to run it while the computer boots.)

**Is it a virus?**
No.

**Will it encrypt my hard disk?**
No.

**Is it a virus?**
I already said, no.

**Is the exe file signed?**
No, I wanted to avoid instances of someone accidentally distributing the file via GPO to the entire organization.
